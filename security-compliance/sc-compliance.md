It is the customer’s responsibility to familiarize themselves with these processes and to manage data retention and removal from the service according to the customer’s policies. To facilitate this process, no cardholder data can be used in an {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} document ID. If PAN data is to be stored in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}, they must be rendered unreadable (in accordance with PCI requirement 3.4) before transmission to the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} service.
