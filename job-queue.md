{: #job-queue-process}

## About job queue
{: #about-job-queue}

When a user generates plan, as a shared service {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} queues all the user's jobs into a single job queue. Your jobs reside in a queue until scheduled to run in an environment. {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} job queues use a scheduler to equitably available for the respective users.

**Example**

If an `user-1` has 20 jobs waiting in the queue, and `user-2` submits a new job. `User-2` job waits into a queue, ahead of `user-1's` 20 jobs to make {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} equitably available for both `user-1` and `user-2`.
