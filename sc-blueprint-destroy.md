{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Blueprints is a [Beta feature](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-beta-limitations) that is available for evaluation and testing purposes. It is not intended for production usage. Refer to the list of [limitations](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-beta-limitations) for the Beta release.

# Destroying a Blueprint
{: #destroy-blueprint}

The cloud resources created by a Blueprint are destroyed using the `blueprint destroy` command. If it is then needed to remove the Blueprint from Schematics, this is performed after all resources have been destroyed using the [blueprint delete](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sc-blueprint-delete) command. Refer to [Blueprints lifecycle](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-blueprint-lifecycle-cmds) to understand the role of the Blueprint commands create, update and delete and the Blueprints lifecycle.Â 

For Terraform Workspaces, destroy runs a Terraform destroy operation against each Workspace in turn. This removes all cloud resources in reverse dependency order.    

The following command performs a Blueprint destroy for the Blueprint with the ID `eu-de.BLUEPRINT.Blueprint-Basic-Example.21735936`

```sh
ibmcloud schematics blueprints destroy -id eu-de.BLUEPRINT.Blueprint-Basic-Example.21735936
```
{: pre}

On successful completion the destroy command will return **fullfilment_success**. 

For more information, about the command options, see [Destroy command](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-blueprint-destroy).



## Verfiy Blueprint destroy success 
{: #bp-verify-destroy}

Verify that the Blueprint resources have been destroyed successfully. When you run destroy from the CLI, the command displays details of the Workspaces to be destroyed and the status of {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} jobs executing the Terraform destroy operations. After prompting to confirm that the user intends to destory all resources, the command only returns on completion.

On successful completion the destroy command will return **fullfillment_success**.

Successful command completion and the status of the Workspaces as `Inactive` indicates that resources in all linked Workspaces have been destroyed


## Next steps
{: #bp-destroy-nextsteps}

After the cloud resources are destroyed, the Blueprint can be [deleted](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sc-blueprint-delete) from {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}. Alternatively the cloud environment can be re-constituted and the resources re-created by running [blueprint install](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sc-blueprint-install) again using the same Blueprint configuration.
