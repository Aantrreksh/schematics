{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Blueprints is a [Beta feature](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-beta-limitations) that is available for evaluation and testing purposes. It is not intended for production usage. Refer to the list of [limitations](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-beta-limitations) for the Beta release.

# Deleting a Blueprint
{: #delete-blueprint}

When a Blueprint environment is no longer needed, it enters the delete lifecycle stage. See [Deleting Blueprint environments](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-delete-blueprints) to understand the process of deleting Blueprint environments and the steps. Deleting a Blueprint environment is a two-stage process of first destroys all the associated cloud resources and then deleting the Blueprint in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}.
{: shortdesc}


Blueprint delete is the second step that is needed to completely delete a Blueprint from {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}. To protect from accidental deletion, a Blueprint can be deleted when cloud resources in all the linked Workspaces are deleted and the Workspaces are in `Inactive` state.Â The first step is to run the [destroy](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-destroy-blueprint&interface=ui) command to destroy the resources that are used in the Workspaces.

This behavior can be modified by using the `-force-delete` flag to allow deletion when Workspaces cannot be returned to an `Inactive` state.

## Deleting Blueprint from the CLI
{: #delete-blueprint-cli}
{: cli}

For more information, see [delete command](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-blueprint-delete). You need to run Blueprint destroy command and then run Blueprint delete command. For more information, see [Deleting a workspace](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-workspace-setup&interface=ui#del-workspace).

For all the Blueprints commands, syntax, and option flag details, see [Blueprints commands](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#blueprints-cmd).
{: important}

```sh
ibmcloud schematics blueprint delete --id Blueprint_Basic.eaB.5cd9
```
{: pre}

Output

```text
SNO Type Name Status
1 terraform basic-resource-group INACTIVE
2 terraform basic-cos-storage INACTIVE

### Verify Blueprint delete 
{: #verify-bp-delete-cli}

During the Beta, the delete CLI command does not wait for successful job completion and returns immediately. 

The status of the delete operation can be monitored by using the `blueprint job get` command. The following command sets a Blueprint `job get` for the JOB ID `eu-gb.JOB.Blueprint-Basic-Example.f2d388d3`. The job ID is displayed in the delete command output. 

```sh
mcloud schematics blueprint job get --id us-east.JOB.Blueprint_Basic.e4081308
```
{: pre}


```text
ID                      us-east.JOB.Blueprint_Basic.e4081308   
Blueprint ID            Blueprint_Basic.eaB.5cd9   
Job Type                blueprint_delete   
Location                us-east
Start Time              2022-08-03 15:51:12
End Time                2022-08-03 15:54:11    
                           
OK
```
{: screen}

During the delete operation that the status shows `In Progress`, when completed the status changes to `Normal`. The Blueprint and all the depended cloud resources are now deleted. 

For more information, see [troubleshooting section](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-apply-fails&interface=cli).

## Deleting a Blueprint from the UI 
{: #delete-blueprint-ui}
{: ui}

You can delete a Blueprint from command line by using the [delete command](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference&interface=cli#schematics-blueprint-delete).

### Verify Blueprint deletion 
{: #verify-bp-deletion-ui}

After deletion, the Blueprint is not displayed in the UI. 

## Deleting a Blueprint from the API
{: #delete-blueprint-api}
{: api}

Follow the [steps](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-api#cs_api) to retrieve your IAM access token and authenticate with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} by using the API. For more information, see [Delete a Blueprint](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#delete-blueprint) by using API. 

You need to run Blueprint destroy command and then run Blueprint delete command. For more information, see [Deleting a workspace](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-workspace-setup&interface=ui#del-workspace).


Record the Blueprint ID that needs to be deleted. To list the Blueprint ID, run [get all the blueprint instances](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#list-blueprint) command.
