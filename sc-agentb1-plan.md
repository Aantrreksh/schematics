# Planning agent
{: #plan-agent-overview}

Prepare to create and deploy an agent by using {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}. You must complete the following tasks:

- The agent needs {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_full}} services with minimum three worker nodes, with a flavor of b4x16 or higher.
- You need to have administrator access, when you are accessing the resources such as {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, and so on.
- You need full permission to access the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Workspace from other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
