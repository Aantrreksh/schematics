{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} Agent beta-1 delivers a simplified agent installation process. You can review the [beta-1 release](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-relnotes&interface=cli#schematics-mar2223) documentation and explore. 
{: attention}

{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agent is a [beta-1 feature](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-agent-beta1-limitations) that is available for evaluation and testing purposes. It is not intended for production usage.

# Preparing for agent deployment
{: #plan-agent-overview}

Agents for {{site.data.keyword.bplong}} extends its ability to work directly with your cloud infrastructure on your private network or in any network isolation zones. {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agents is a collection of microservices that are deployed in your Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. It uses an {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} bucket as an intermediate or temporary datastore for the log files and state-files generated by the Terraform or Ansible automation.
{: shortdesc}

Review and complete the tasks below to prepare your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment to deploy a new agent.

- **Kubernetes cluster:** A {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} agent can be deployed on any existing private or public infrastructure such as [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters), [{{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cluster-create-vpc-gen2&interface=ui), or [{{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_full}}](/openshift?topic=openshift-clusters) clusters. You can use an existing cluster or provision a new cluster with the following minimum configuration.
   - Minimum configuration: Three worker nodes with `b4x16` flavor. This configuration can be used to run four Terraform or Ansible automation in parallel.
   - Record the key information such as `cluster ID`, `cluster resource group`,  and `location` about the cluster for the later use.
- **{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}:** The {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agent uses {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} bucket to store temporary data. You must provision a new bucket for an agent in a region that is preferably closer to the region where the agent's Kubernetes cluster is provisioned.
    - While deploying an agent, you must have the necessary privileges to create the `HMAC credentials` for the {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} bucket and store the credential as Kubernetes secret.
    - Record the key information such as `COS instance name`, `COS bucket name`, `COS bucket region`, and `COS resource group` about the COS resources for the later use.
- **IAM access permission:** You must have the minimum access permissions for the Kubernetes service, Resource Group, {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}}, and the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} service to [deploy an agent](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-deploy-agent-overview&interface=cli).
    - If you are invited to deploy an agent in another {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, or if you are using a `ServiceID` or `APIKey` to deploy an agent. Then you must ensure that the account administrator has granted the required permission for all the services enlisted in [permission to deploy an agent](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access#agent-permissions).
- **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI:** Use the latest version of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and the [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} CLI v1.12.8](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-cli#install-schematics-plugin) or higher plugin to install an agent. For more information about plugin installation, see [installing {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} CLI plugin](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-cli#install-schematics-plugin).

You can deploy only one agent instance in a single Kubernetes cluster. You can create and deploy multiple agents in a single {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account on different Kubernetes cluster. Each catering to different network isolation zones in your Cloud environment.
{: note}

In the Beta release, an agent can connect to only one {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. It cannot be shared with other accounts.

You are advised to monitor the resource usage for the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agent pods to scale the worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. In the Beta-1 release, you can use the **Kubernetes dashboards** or [kubectl](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) commands for the change  
    - in the number of parallel jobs of Terraform, and Ansible.
    - in the number of Terraform, and Ansible pods.
    - in the resource limits for tanhe agent deployment.
