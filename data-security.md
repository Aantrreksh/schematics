# Securing your data
{: #secure-data}

Review what data is stored and encrypted when you use {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}, and how you can delete any personal data. 
{: shortdesc}

## What information is stored in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}?
{: #pi-data}

The following information is stored with IBM when you create and use a {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspace: 
- Workspace details
- Workspace variables
- Terraform configuration files that your workspace points to
- Terraform state files
- Terraform log files
- User activity logs

## Where is my information stored?
{: #pi-location}

By default, all information that is stored in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} is encrypted in transit and at rest. To make your data highly available, all data is stored in one region and replicated to another region in the same geography. Make sure that your data can be stored in these regions before you start using {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}. 

|Data is stored in|Data is replicated to|
|------|--------|
| `us-south` | `us-east` | 

## How is my information encrypted?
The following image shows the main {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} components, how they interact with each other, and what type of encryption is applied to your data.

1. A user sends a request to create an {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} workspace to the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} API server.
2. The API server retrieves the Terraform template and input variables from your GitHub or GitLab source repository. 
3. All user-initiated actions, such as creating a workspace, generating a Terraform execution plan, or applying a plan are sent to RabbitMQ and added to the internal queue. RabbitMQ forwards requests to the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} engine to execute the action. 
4. The {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} engine starts the process for provisioning, modifying, or deleting {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. 
5. To protect customer data in transit, {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} integrates with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} uses root keys in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} to create data encryption keys (DEK). The DEK is then used to encrypt workspace transactional data, such as logs, or the Terraform `tf.state` file in transit. 
6. Workspace transactional data is stored in an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket and encrypted by using [Server-Side Encryption with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-encryption#encryption-kp) at rest.  
7. Workspace operational data, such as the workspace variables and Terraform template information, is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudant}} and encrypted at rest by using the default service encryption. For more information, see [Security](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-security).

## How can I delete my information?
{: #delete-data}

To remove your data from {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}, choose among the following options: 
- **Delete the workspace**: When you delete your workspace, all data related to a workspace is permanently deleted. 
- **Open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support case**: Contact IBM Support to remove your workspaces and any associated data by opening a support case. For more information, see [Getting support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support). 
- **End your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} subscription**: A {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} cleanup job runs multiple times a day to verify that all workspaces that are stored with IBM belong to an active {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. If no active account is found, the workspace and all associated data are deleted.
