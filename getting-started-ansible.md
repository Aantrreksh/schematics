# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} and Ansible 
{: #getting-started-ansible}


Enable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}, by running Ansible playbooks against your inventory of {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} resources. Use Ansible to install software packages, and application code on VSIs. Or use it to perform post provisioning configuration of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources, deployed by using {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} and Terraform. 

## What is Ansible?
{: #about-ansible}

[Ansible ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ansible.com/) is a configuration management,and provisioning tool, similar to [Chef ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra/) and [Puppet ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://puppet.com/), and is designed to automate multitier app deployments and provisioning in the cloud. Written in Python, Ansible uses YAML syntax to describe automation tasks, which makes Ansible easy to learn and use. 

## How does Ansible work?
{: #ansible-work}

Ansible does not use agents or a custom security infrastructure that must be present on a target machine to work properly. Instead, Ansible connects to compute hosts over the public network by using SSH keys and a bastion host to create a secure connection. The SSH keys to be used for VSI and bastion host access are configured on your virtual service instances when you order. You can choose from your own SSH keys and upload SSH key to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} portal. For more information, on SSH key, refer to [SSH Keys](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys).

Ansible models software packages, configuration, and services as resources on a managed host to ensure that the resource is in a specific state. To bring a resource to the required state, Ansible pushes modules to the managed host to run the required tasks. After the tasks are executed, the result is returned to the Ansible server and the module is removed from the managed host. You can use Ansible modules to execute a specific operation or group scripts and configurations in the Ansible playbook that you want to execute. Ansible modules are idempotent such that executing the same playbook or operation multiple times returns the same result as resources are changed only if required.

## How do Ansible and Schematics work together?
{: #ansible-in-schematics}

Ansible and Schematics are complementary solutions, each addressing a key area of application and IaC management. Schematics provides workspace, Terraform resources, module templates to manage the infrastructure, whereas Ansible helps you to provision use case, config management and deploy an app as a secured application.

The functions of the Schematics action in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} are:

- Describes the input configuration for your Ansible playbook.
- You can use the Schematics action definition to deploy multitier apps, set up firewall rules.Â 
- You need to specify the tasks that you want to run and let {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} securely connect and complete the tasks on your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources.
- Runs the playbook in a repeatable, reliable and consistent manner.

{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} actions specifies:

- How you point your action to the Ansible playbook in your GitHub repository?
- It defines your resource inventory where you want to run your playbook.
- It runs your Ansible playbook in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}.
