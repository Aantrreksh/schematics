# Detecting drift in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}
{: #drift-note}

{{site.data.keyword.bplong}} is the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} automation tool that enables you to deploy, manage, and manipulate infrastructure resources with Terraform based workspaces by using the well-known `declarative` Infrastructure as code (IaC) concept. However, as Terraform is properly deployed as declared, does not mean TerraformÂ stays as declared. The changing of the infrastructure desired state is called `drift`. When the state of your infrastructure differs from the state defined in your template configuration. Technically speaking, whenever the state file of your deployed workspace is not in synchronised with your infrastructure resources that are deployed, such workspace is said to `Drifted`.
{: shortdesc}

Drift can happen for many reasons. It happens within the context of your configuration.
- When adding or removing resources. 
- When changing resource definitions. 
- External to your template configuration, drift occurs when changes have been made manually. For example, from a command-line operation on Cloud resources, Manual modification of the resources from Cloud console. 
- Can occur through other automation tools.

## Scenario
{: #drift-scenario}

A VSI instance is provisioned by using {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} and desired configuration templates. A DevOps cloud user modifies the provisioned VSI configuration by logging into the Cloud console and modifying the boot volume of the instance or adding ethernet interface. By doing that, even your intentioned and desired infrastructure deployment gets `Drifted`.

{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} enables you to safely and predictably [manage the resource lifecycle](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-manage-lifecycle) of your infrastructure by using Terraform. One challenge when managing infrastructure as code is drift. Drift is the term for when the real world state of your infrastructure differs from the state defined in your Terraform template configuration. 

Terraform cannot detect drift of resources and their associated attributes that are not managed by using Terraform. For example, Terraform do not detect changes in a virtual machine that have occurred as a result of installing applications locally or using a configuration management tool like `Chef` or `Ansible`.

## Drift detection in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #drift-in-ibm}

{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} can now detect drift for your Terraform automation workspaces. You can use following two methods to check the drift detection.

- Drift detection from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console
- Drift detection from CLI

## Drift detection through {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} UI
{: #drift-ui}
{: ui}

You can initiate detecting drift for workspaces from the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspace job page. This event initiates a job to detect drift for the workspace and its specific resources. The drift detection job is `in progress` or `completed` with the appropriate status such as `failure` or `success`. In order to know the details of the drift job, you need to check the drift job log. The log provides the details of the drift status.

### Viewing detect drift through UI
{: #drift-view-ui}

Use the following steps to view the detect drift

1. From the [workspace dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/workspaces){: external}, select the workspace that you want to view detect drift.
2. Select and open your workspace.
3. Click **Actions** tab
4. Select **Detect drift** option to view the drift job is in `completed` with a `success` status or `in progress` with a `failure` status. The sample success example and failure example job log are shown in the screen capture.

    The success example job log in order to identify the drift details.

## Drift detection through {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} CLI
{: #drift-cli}
{: cli}

You can initiate detecting drift for workspaces from the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspace details page. Click the Actions menu to view the `Detect drift` options. This event then initiates a job to detect drift for the workspace and its specific resources. A drift detection job entry is available in the workspace jobs page. The drift detection job is `in progress` or `completed` with the appropriate status such as `failure` or `success`. In order to know the details of the drift job, you need to check the drift job log. The log provides the details of the drift status.

### Viewing detect drift through CLI
{: #drift-view-cli}
{: cli}

Review the commands that you can use to view the detect drift by using the job run command
{: shortdesc}

1. Execute [`ibmcloud schematics job run`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-run-job) to create a job in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} workspace.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud schematics job run --command-object workspace --command-object-id <workspace_id> --command-name drift
    ```
    {: pre}
    
2. Execute [`ibmcloud schematics workspace action`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-action) to retrieve all activities of your workspace.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud schematics workspace action --id <workspace_id>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Execute  [`ibmcloud schematics job logs`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-logs-job) to retrieve the detailed logs of a job to view the drift details.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud schematics logs --id <workspace_id> --act-id <Job_id>
    ```
    {: pre}
