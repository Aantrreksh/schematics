{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} Agent [beta-1](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-relnotes&interface=cli#schematics-mar2223) delivers a simplified Agents installation process.
{: attention}

{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agent is a [beta-1 feature](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-agent-beta1-limitations) that is available for evaluation and testing purposes. It is not intended for production usage.
{: beta}

# {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agent
{: #agentb1-about-intro}

Agents for the {{site.data.keyword.bplong}} extends its ability to work directly with your cloud infrastructure on your private cloud network or in any network isolation zones. The agents are deployed in the Kubernetes clusters in your private network, and is able to access your private cloud resources.
{: shortdesc}

It is important to note that {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} do not have direct access to an agent or any private cloud resources.The agent always initiates the communication with {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} service, and polls for jobs that must be run on an agent. You are in control of the agent resources, its network policies, and of underlying Kubernetes cluster.
{: note}

Note: Schematics identifies your agent using a Trusted Profile identity provided by the Kubernetes cluster that it runs on.  This identity is dynamically created, when the agent is created & deployed.   The Trusted Profile identity guarantees that no one can spoof your Agentâ€™s identity, and steal data from Schematics.  
You are in control of the access permissions defined for this Trusted Profile identity, using IAM Access Policies. 


Use Agents located on your private network to provision, configure and access your cloud or on-premises services and cluster resources, managed by your own network access policies. Eliminate execution time limits and enable Terraform and Ansible to access and work with private network resources, and in future use software utilities of your own choosing.
{: shortdesc}

The agent runtime includes `Terraform`, `Terraform CLI v1.0.11`, `Terraform CLI v1.1.5`, `Ansible`, and additional micro-services. For more information about the software utilities included in the agent runtime, see [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} runtime deployment utilities](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sch-utilities).

## Benefits of using Agents
{: #agentb1-usage}

The following are some of the benefits of using {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} Agents compared to using the default multi-tenant service offering:

- Use [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics) and [{{site.data.keyword.satellitelong}}](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-getting-started) to deploy and configure hybrid cloud resources, including private cloud resources, private data center resources, and other public cloud resources.
- Use {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} to securely connect to and manage hybrid cloud infrastructure by using [Terraform](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-about), [Ansible](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-getting-started-ansible), and other automation tools to perform deployments, configuration, and day-2 operations.
- Reduce the time waiting for {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} job execution to start by using private job queues to run your automation.
- Use dedicated infrastructure to run your automation and scale up or scale down the capacity depending on your automation workloads.
- Fine gained control over network access policies to access private network resources, configuring [ingress](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-kube-policies) or egress rules that are used by Agents to connect to your hybrid cloud infrastructure.
- Use your own software, and versions in conjunction with automation engine provided by the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} runtime.

## {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agent architecture
{: #about-agentb1-architecture}

The diagram illustrates the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agent architecture, and the location of Terraform and Ansible job execution within a users private cloud network.

The difference between job execution in the multi-tenant service and using Agents can seen by comparing this diagram with the deployment architectures for [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Workspaces](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sc-workspaces) and [{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Actions](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sc-actions).

![{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agents networking](images/new/sc-agents-network.svg){: caption="{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Agents networking" caption-side="bottom"}

In this figure, when using Agents, Terraform, and Ansible jobs run on the users private cloud network. They have direct access to a users cloud resources via the users private cloud network. For direct configuration of cloud resources using Ansible or Terraform using SSH, access is via the private network which eliminates the need for Bastion Hosts and the routing of access via the public network. Terraform and Ansible access to private resources is under direct user control via user defined network security policies.
